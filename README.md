## Examples for usage

To call the help for vcard2fritzxml:

    java -jar /PATH/TO/git-repo/target/vcard2fritzXML-0.4.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar -h


To create a csv template file (template.csv) in the actual directory:

    java -jar /PATH/TO/git-repo/target/vcard2fritzXML-0.4.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar -t csv -c


To create a vcf template file (template.vcf) in the actual directory:

    java -jar /PATH/TO/git-repo/target/vcard2fritzXML-0.4.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar -t vcf -c


To convert a vcf file from standard out to the Fritz!Box xml format:

    cat template.vcf | java -jar vcard2fritzXML-0.4.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar -t vcf -f - 


To convert the vcard file to the Fritz!Box xml format and print out to standard out:

    java -jar /PATH/TO/git-repo/target/vcard2fritzXML-0.4.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar -t vcf -f "<PATH/TO/VCARDFILE.vcf>" 


To convert the vcard file to the Fritz!Box xml format and save it to file:

    java -jar vcard2fritzXML-0.4.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar -t vcf -f "<PATH/TO/VCARDFILE.vcf>" -o "<PATH/TO/OUTFILE.xml"


To convert the vcard file to the Fritz!Box xml format and set the address book name to "Syncronized":

    java -jar vcard2fritzXML-0.4.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar -t vcf -f "<PATH/TO/VCARDFILE.vcf>" -n "Syncronized"


## Import into Fritz!Box
Go to your Fritz!Box and create a new Telphonebook named "Addressbook" or as set via command line and recover your Telephonebook with the XML file.
